# Recovery checkpoint

Partial/frozen Turso typed-key storage and decoding cutover, schema bump, collision/cursor/corruption fixtures. Final completeness review and Rust tests remain pending.

This preserves frozen working source, not an accepted integration or release. No real worktree index, HEAD, branch, or merge state was changed. The default canonical branch was not moved.

`merge-index-stages.nul` and `index-objects/` preserve staged-only content. To reconstruct the index, use a separate checkout and temporary GIT_INDEX_FILE; feed the NUL records to git update-index -z --index-info after git read-tree --empty. Do not overwrite the existing integration index.
