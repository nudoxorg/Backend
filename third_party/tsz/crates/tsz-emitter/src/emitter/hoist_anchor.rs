//! Captured insertion point for deferred hoist-line writes.
//!
//! Several emit paths buffer `var _a;` / `let _x;` declarations during
//! statement emission and then insert the combined `var ...;` line back at
//! a previously-captured offset (the function-body's opening line). The
//! interval between capture and insertion may grow the writer's live
//! `indent_level` - most commonly when a block-level `using` lowering
//! opens a `try {` wrapper before any statement emits. Recomputing the
//! indent from the live level at insertion time would push the hoist
//! line past the surrounding scope's indent; capturing the level at
//! anchor time pins the insertion to the right column.
