//! Union-target member-frame elaboration for structural best-member failures.
//!
//! When a non-fresh source fails against a union target and the solver's
//! best-member selection (`SubtypeChecker::select_union_target_best_member`)
//! picks a constituent whose failure is *not* a missing required property,
//! `tsc` (`getBestMatchingType`) re-runs the failed relation against that
//! member with errors enabled — so the diagnostic chain continues past the
//! union head with a member frame and the member relation's own drill. The
//! missing-property fold and the fresh-object-literal expression elaboration
//! keep their existing paths; this renderer owns only the member-frame shape.
