//! tsc's `The expected type comes from the return type of this signature.`
//! (`TS6502`) pointer.
//!
//! Structural rule, oracle-pinned against `typescript@7.0.2`
//! (`scripts/conformance/oracle.sh --strict --pretty`): when an object-literal
//! member's value is an expression-bodied arrow and the elaboration drilled to
//! the arrow's *body*, the `TS2322` reported there carries a pointer at the
//! declaration of the callable the expected return type came from — never at
//! the member's name, which is the sibling `TS6500` anchor.
//!
//! ```text
//! interface Ret { cb: () => string; }
//! const rt: Ret = { cb: () => 6 };
//!
//! a.ts:2:29 - error TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
//!   a.ts:1:21 - The expected type comes from the return type of this signature.
//!     1 interface Ret { cb: () => string; }
//!                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~
//! ```
//!
//! The anchor is the *signature declaration*, which is why the two member
//! shapes underline different text: a property signature annotated with a
//! function type points at the **annotation** (`() => string`), while a method
//! signature has no separate annotation node and points at the **whole member**
//! (`m(): string;`, trailing semicolon included — the same span `TS2728`
//! already uses for a method signature).
//!
//! Deliberately reached from syntax and not from the type. The expected return
//! type is carried by an interned [`tsz_solver::types::FunctionShape`], which
//! has no declaration and cannot be given one: excluded from identity it would
//! be shared by every structurally identical signature in the program and the
//! second occurrence would anchor into the first one's file. That is the same
//! soundness wall that sank tsz#16454's `PropertyInfo::declared_location`
//! route, so the owner's *written* member list is the only per-occurrence
//! source of an anchor here.
//!
//! The owner-candidate route above needs a binder symbol, which an *anonymous*
//! owner never has — a type literal mints none at all (tsz#16443), so a nested
//! member (`interface Outer { inner: { cb: () => string } }`), an inline
//! annotation (`const x: { cb: () => string } = ...`) and a type-alias-to-type-
//! literal owner all declined. When every candidate declines, the same
//! annotation walk `missing_property_declared_here_related` uses for `TS2728`
//! and `expected_type_from_property_related` uses for `TS6500` recovers the
//! anchor from the object-literal syntax at the failure site instead, and then
//! narrows from the member to its signature exactly as the symbol route does.
//!
//! That walk also owns the *alias hop* the symbol route cannot take: for
//! `type Fn = () => string; interface Ref { cb: Fn }` tsc anchors inside `Fn`'s
//! body, not at `Fn` and not at `cb`. Following an alias means reading a
//! declaration's `NodeIndex`, which is only sound in the arena that minted it,
//! so the hop lives here — where every step is already checking-file-local —
//! rather than in the cross-arena symbol route.
//!
//! Shapes that still decline rather than guess, each pinned by a test:
//!
//! * a call argument (`take(() => 7)`) — the expected type comes from a
//!   parameter, not from an owner's member list, so there is no annotation to
//!   walk and no owner to resolve;
//! * an annotation that does not declare the written path, which declines at
//!   the hop that fails rather than anchoring one member too shallow.
