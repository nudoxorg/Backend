//! Checker-side access to the stamp-guarded assignability failure-analysis
//! memo (issue #13243).
//!
//! A failing TS2322/TS2345 assignment currently executes the
//! reason-collecting relation more than once on identical prepared inputs:
//! once through the `RelationRequest` gateway that picks the diagnostic
//! shape (`assignability_reason_relation_outcome` and friends) and again
//! inside `analyze_assignability_failure` when the error reporter builds the
//! elaboration chain. Both passes run the same configured solver checker
//! over the same `(prepared source, prepared target, solver flags,
//! sound-mode)` key, so the second is a pure re-walk of the most expensive
//! operation in the compiler. These helpers let both call sites share one
//! captured analysis under the [`crate::context::AssignabilityEvalStamp`]
//! validity model: entries are dropped wholesale whenever the session stamp
//! moves, so a hit replays exactly what a fresh pass under the current
//! environment would produce.
