//! A cross-file `.prototype` write onto a NESTED expando property
//! (`a.d.prototype = e`, where `d` is itself an expando member of `a`, not a
//! directly-declared symbol) is a legitimate class-shape declaration exactly
//! when `d`'s own declaring assignment is a function-or-class expression —
//! the only RHS shapes that carry an intrinsic `.prototype`.
//!
//! Structural rule (oracle-pinned against tsc 6.0.2, `--checkJs --allowJs`):
//!
//! > `a.d.prototype = e` is accepted (no `TS2339`) when every visible
//! > `a.d = rhs` declaring assignment has a function-expression, arrow, or
//! > class-expression RHS — matching the intrinsic `.prototype` every
//! > function/class value carries. A closed-shape RHS (`a.d = { x: 1 }`)
//! > keeps `TS2339`: an ordinary object has no `.prototype` member.
//!
//! `d` is a binder-tracked expando chain-key entry on `a`, never a real
//! declaration `resolve_identifier_symbol`/`resolve_qualified_symbol` can
//! find — unlike a plain identifier root (`function C() {}` / `C.prototype`),
//! which already had dedicated handling
//! (`js_prototype_write_root_is_callable_or_constructible`). This exercises
//! the nested-chain fallback added alongside it
//! (`nested_expando_base_link_rhs_is_callable`).
