//! TS7005 for a non-empty array literal whose widened element type is `any`
//! due to non-strict null/undefined widening — e.g. `var b = [undefined,
//! null]` widens to `any[]`, and tsc reports the implicit-any at the
//! declaration site the same way it does for a bare scalar `any`.
//!
//! Structural rule: `widen_initializer_type_for_mutable_binding_gated`
//! already widens a fresh array literal's `null`/`undefined` leaves to `any`
//! when `strictNullChecks` is off and every nullish leaf found is a genuine
//! widening source (`initializer_nullish_leaves_are_widening`,
//! `types/utilities/mutable_binding_nullish.rs`) — but nothing downstream
//! ever reported the resulting implicit-any. The existing TS7005 checks in
//! `state/variable_checking/core.rs` only fire for a *bare* `final_type ==
//! TypeId::ANY` (no initializer) or a direct *empty* array literal (deferred
//! "evolving any" tracking); a non-empty literal whose widened element type
//! is `any` fell through both and was silently accepted.
//!
//! Owner: `state/variable_checking/core.rs`'s
//! `compound_nullish_widening_implicit_any`, which checks the *resulting*
//! element type (`query::array_element_type(..) == Some(TypeId::ANY)`)
//! rather than walking the initializer's syntax for a nullish leaf — a mixed
//! literal like `[1, undefined]` reduces its best-common-type to `number`
//! (verified against the real `tsc` 6.0.2 oracle: no diagnostic at all), so
//! an AST-only "contains a nullish leaf" gate would have been wrong. Unlike
//! the bare-scalar case, this fires unconditionally at the declaration site
//! regardless of `var`/`let`/`const`: a non-empty literal's type is never
//! "evolving," so there is no deferred-tracking mechanism for it to go
//! through. Object literals are deliberately excluded — an implicit-any
//! property inside a fresh object literal already gets its own per-property
//! TS7018, and tsc does not additionally report TS7005 for the variable.
//!
//! Every row below is pinned against a real `tsc` 6.0.2 oracle
//! (`/opt/node22/bin/tsc`), `--target es2015 --strict false --noImplicitAny true`.
