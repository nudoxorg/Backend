//! Lifetime-class shell types for the T2.1 checker lifetime split.
//!
//! These structs are intentionally **empty** in this initial pass. They exist
//! as named types that future T2.1 PRs will populate with fields migrated out
//! of `CheckerContext`. The empty types serve three immediate purposes:
//!
//! 1. **Reviewers can grep** for `WorkerContext` / `FileSession` /
//!    `SpeculationScope` / `LspPersistentCache` and see exactly where the
//!    architecture is heading, even before fields move.
//! 2. **The field-lifetime manifest** at
//!    `crates/tsz-checker/src/context/checker_context_lifetimes.toml` can
//!    eventually mark each entry's "destination shell" alongside its
//!    `lifetime` class. The shells make those destinations real types,
//!    not just doc-comment strings.
//! 3. **Future PRs are smaller and more reviewable.** Each subsequent
//!    T2.1.B+ PR migrates a single bucket of fields into one of these
//!    shells. The structural target already exists; the migration PR only
//!    moves data.
//!
//! These shells implement no methods today. **Do not add behavior to them
//! until the corresponding T2.1.B/C/D PR**, where the migration of the
//! relevant fields is reviewed alongside the new behavior.
//!
//! Mapping from each manifest lifetime class to its destination shell:
//!
//! ```text
//! ProgramStable      -> ProgramContext      — already exists (renamed from ProjectEnv in PR 5B)
//! WorkerReusable     -> WorkerContext       — this file
//! FileLocalReset     -> FileSession         — this file
//! DiagnosticsOnly    -> FileSession         — this file
//! SpeculationScoped  -> SpeculationScope    — this file
//! LspPersistent      -> LspPersistentCache  — this file
//! ```
//!
//! This class -> shell mapping is **CI-enforced** by
//! `scripts/arch/checker_field_inventory.py` (the `LIFETIME_DESTINATION_SHELL`
//! contract): every classifiable lifetime must name a destination shell, and
//! every named shell must exist as a `pub struct` here (or, for
//! `ProgramContext`, in `program_context.rs`). Run
//! `python3 scripts/arch/checker_field_inventory.py --shells` for the
//! per-shell migration burndown.
