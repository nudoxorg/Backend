//! Debug-only purity invariant for the stamp-keyed assignability memos
//! (issue #13980).
//!
//! [`AssignabilityEvalMemo`](super::caches::AssignabilityEvalMemo),
//! [`AwaitedAssignabilityEvalMemo`](super::caches::AwaitedAssignabilityEvalMemo)
//! and [`AssignabilityFailureMemo`](super::caches::AssignabilityFailureMemo) all
//! encode the same contract: for a fixed
//! [`AssignabilityEvalStamp`](super::caches::AssignabilityEvalStamp) — the two
//! type-environment generations plus the symbol-type cache versions — the
//! memoized value is a *pure function* of the key, so "a hit always returns
//! exactly what a fresh evaluation under the current environment would".
//!
//! Issue #13980 traced a class of bug where that contract is silently broken:
//! the eagerness with which `ensure_refs_resolved` / `ensure_relation_input_ready`
//! forces `Lazy(DefId)` refs is a **hidden input** that is not folded into the
//! stamp, yet it can change which `TypeId` an expression evaluates to
//! (index-access, `Promise` unwrap, generic-constraint elaboration, ...). The
//! sound direction is consumption-driven forcing; until that lands, the
//! resolution mode is "load-bearing for type identity" and any laziness tweak
//! in the #12101 campaign can change computed types in a way the diagnostic
//! conformance floor does not catch.
//!
//! This module is the debug-only invariant the issue asks for. It does not
//! change the resolution strategy; it makes the latent footgun observable. The
//! detection point is cheap and exact: a memo `insert` that overwrites an
//! existing entry **for the same stamp** with a **different** value is, by the
//! purity contract, impossible — so when it happens a hidden input leaked. The
//! displaced value is already returned by `HashMap::insert`, so the check adds
//! no extra lookup, and the whole module compiles out of release builds.
//!
//! Reporting is non-fatal by default (a `tracing::warn!` plus a process-wide
//! counter) so it never destabilises CI on a path that is only latently
//! unsound. Set `TSZ_EVAL_MEMO_PURITY_PANIC=1` to escalate a divergence to a
//! panic when actively hunting the leak.
