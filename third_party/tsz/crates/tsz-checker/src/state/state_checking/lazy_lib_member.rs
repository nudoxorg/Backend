//! Lazy single-member resolution for simple lib-interface receivers.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! Value-position property access on a global like `document.title` currently
//! materializes the **entire** `Document` structural shape (~200 members) and
//! its transitive `extends` heritage closure just to read one `string` member.
//! Measured on `const c = document.title;` with `ES2020 + DOM + DOM.Iterable`,
//! this interns ~9216 types vs ~716 for `const c = 1;`. The dominant cost is the
//! eager lowering of every own member's type annotation and method signature —
//! heritage merging is only ~16% of the gap; the rest is the full own-member
//! lowering and the referenced-interface cascade.
//!
//! tsc/tsgo resolve only the accessed member. This module is the value-position
//! counterpart to PR #8638 (`perf(checker): preserve lazy lib interface refs`),
//! which already keeps **type-position** annotations (`let d: Document`) lazy.
//!
//! # Structural rule
//!
//! > When resolving a property access `recv.p` whose receiver type is a
//! > `Lazy(DefId)` reference to a non-generic, unmerged, unaugmented,
//! > unshadowed lib interface, resolve only member `p` (including a
//! > heritage-inherited declaration of `p`) on demand, instead of materializing
//! > the receiver's entire structural object shape and transitive `extends`
//! > closure.
//!
//! # Soundness
//!
//! The eligibility predicate ([`CheckerState::lazy_lib_member_receiver_def_id`])
//! is intentionally conservative and mirrors the #8638 predicate
//! (`try_lower_simple_actual_lib_type_reference`): the receiver must be a bare
//! `Lazy(DefId)` for an actual/cloned-lib **interface** symbol that is
//! non-generic, not compiler-managed, not shadowed by a file-local type, and
//! not globally augmented. Any receiver that fails the predicate falls back to
//! the existing full-materialization path, so behavior is unchanged there.
//!
//! The fast path is additionally gated by the [`lazy_lib_member_access_disabled`]
//! kill-switch (`TSZ_DISABLE_LAZY_MEMBER_ACCESS`) so diagnostics can be compared
//! byte-for-byte with the fast path on vs off.
