//! Cross-file circular type-alias detection (TS2456).
//!
//! Cross-file alias bodies are resolved by delegating to a per-file child
//! checker (see [`super::cross_file`]). A cycle such as `type A = B` in one
//! module and `type B = A` in another would otherwise ping-pong between arenas
//! until the cross-arena depth guard collapses the type to `ERROR`, leaving no
//! alias flagged. This module tracks the aliases currently being resolved on a
//! delegation path (keyed by canonical `DefId`, since raw `SymbolId`s are
//! file-local) and, on re-entry, marks every alias in the cycle circular in the
//! shared `DefinitionStore`. Each file's `check_cross_file_circular_type_aliases`
//! post-pass then emits the TS2456 for its own member, applying the same
//! deferral/suppression rules tsc uses for same-file cycles.
