//! Literal-freshness policy owner (#15390).
//!
//! `tsc` mints a fresh literal type when it checks a literal expression and
//! consults the freshness bit *on the type* when deciding whether an
//! observation point widens it. tsz stores freshness as AST-shape predicates
//! instead, so consumers used to re-derive the literal from the AST (via
//! `literal_type_from_initializer`) or re-model the widening timing (via
//! `is_fresh_literal_expression` plus a widening call) independently at each
//! call site — and every consumer that forgot the recovery or re-modeled the
//! rule wrongly diverged from `tsc` (#15366, #15373).
//!
//! This checker-side module owns the freshness *policy* rules (literal
//! recovery itself stays with `literal_type_from_initializer`; the
//! underlying type widening lives in `crate::query_boundaries::widening`).
//! New display or binding consumers must route through these methods instead
//! of pairing raw `literal_type_from_initializer` /
//! `is_fresh_literal_expression` calls with ad-hoc widening at the call
//! site. The long-term fix is carrying a freshness bit on primitive literal
//! types (as the solver already does for fresh object literals) so widening
//! can consult the type instead of the AST.
