//! Inferred return type aggregation for error-typed and recursive self-call
//! returns.
//!
//! tsc's `checkAndAggregateReturnExpressionTypes` keeps a genuine error-typed
//! return (an unresolved name's `errorType` carries the `Any` flag) and lets
//! `getUnionType` collapse the whole union to `error`/`any`; the ONLY return
//! form it omits is a *direct* recursive self-call (`return self(...)`), whose
//! circular provisional type must not poison the aggregate. tsz previously
//! blanket-dropped every error-typed contribution, which turned
//! `function g() { if (c) return globalThis; return global; }` (unresolved
//! `global`) into `typeof globalThis | undefined` instead of `any`, spuriously
//! flagging downstream property accesses (TS2339). See the class-transformer
//! `getGlobal()` false-positive cluster.
