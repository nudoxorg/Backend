//! Regression tests for the structural flow-cache key used by property and
//! element reference narrowing.
//!
//! Property/element references (`x.a`, `x["a"]`) do not resolve to a single
//! `SymbolId`, so the flow analyzer keys their narrowing cache on a structural
//! reference *path* — `[base_symbol_id, prop_atom, ...]` — interned to a
//! synthetic cache symbol. This lets every syntactic occurrence of the same
//! path share cache entries (turning the previous O(N²) per-occurrence flow
//! re-walk into O(N)).
//!
//! Correctness hinges on the key never aliasing two *different* references.
//! These tests would fail if the structural key dropped the base symbol (so
//! `a.v` and `b.v` collided), dropped the property (so `o.a` and `o.b`
//! collided), or corrupted the narrowed type across repeated reads of the same
//! path.
