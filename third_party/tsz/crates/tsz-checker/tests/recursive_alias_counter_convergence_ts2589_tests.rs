//! Regression tests: a recursive generic type alias that terminates via a
//! second (counter) type parameter, or that ties a finite knot through a
//! homomorphic mapped type over a recursive object, must not raise a spurious
//! TS2589 ("Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite").
//!
//! Structural rule: "When a use site instantiates a recursive alias and the
//! evaluator leaves a residual self-application in a deferred position, that
//! residual is divergence evidence only if its arguments grow strictly along an
//! unbounded dimension (string length, tuple/template arity). A residual that
//! stays the same size or shrinks is making progress — via a numeric depth
//! counter (`N` -> `Exclude<N, 0>`) or a structural descent into `T[K]` — or is
//! tying a finite knot the way tsc defers recursive object/mapped references, and
//! must not raise TS2589."
//!
//! Owner layer: solver convergence metric (`self_application_arg_weight`) +
//! checker use-site probe (`evaluate_type_for_ts2589_check`). The guard against
//! over-correction (genuine string/tuple builders must still raise TS2589) is
//! covered by the `*_still_diverges_*` cases below.
