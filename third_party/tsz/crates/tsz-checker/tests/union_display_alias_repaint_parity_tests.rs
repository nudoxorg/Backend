//! Parity pins for the display alias a rendered type picks up in a diagnostic.
//!
//! `tsc` decides the displayed name of a type from the **type node that was
//! written at the site**: an annotation spelled `Zed` renders as `Zed`, and an
//! annotation spelled `string | number | symbol` renders structurally, even
//! when a `type Zed = string | number | symbol` declaration elsewhere in the
//! program describes exactly that type. `getUnionType` keys its cache on the
//! member list *plus* the alias identity, so the aliased and the longhand
//! spelling are two distinct `Type` objects and neither can repaint the other.
//!
//! tsz interns one `TypeId` per content and carries the alias in a global
//! `TypeId -> alias` side table (`TypeInterner::store_display_alias` /
//! `get_display_alias`), so an alias declared anywhere can repaint a
//! structurally identical type written longhand somewhere else — that was
//! `store_display_alias`'s repaint divergence, fixed by #16645 (originally
//! filed as #16610).
//!
//! Every expectation here was verified against the pinned oracle
//! (`typescript@7.0.2`, `--noEmit --strict --lib es2022 --target es2022`), one
//! file per row so no row can be perturbed by another row's declarations —
//! which matters especially here, since the defect is precisely about one
//! declaration reaching another site.
//!
//! All rows above the "second mechanism" section are a regression floor for
//! the repaint fix. `#[ignore]`d rows below record a separate, still-open
//! divergence (an alias whose RHS collapses to a pre-existing type). Run them
//! with `cargo test -p tsz-checker --test union_display_alias_repaint_parity_tests -- --ignored`.
