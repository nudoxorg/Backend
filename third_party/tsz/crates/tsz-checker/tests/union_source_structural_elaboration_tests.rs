//! Union-source *structural* elaboration (TS2322 + member header + drill).
//!
//! Structural rule: when a *union* value is assigned to a tuple or object
//! target and the first failing member is rejected for a *structural* reason —
//! a tuple element type mismatch or an object property-type mismatch — tsc
//! keeps the top-level `Type 'A | B' is not assignable to type 'T'` (TS2322)
//! and elaborates *which* member fails, leading with the member-type header and
//! then drilling into the structural detail:
//!
//! ```text
//! Type 'B' is not assignable to type 'A'.
//!   Type '[id: number, count: number]' is not assignable to type '[id: string, count: number]'.
//!     Type at position 0 in source is not compatible with type at position 0 in target.
//!       Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
//! ```
//!
//! ```text
//! Type 'B' is not assignable to type 'A'.
//!   Type '{ id: number; count: number; }' is not assignable to type 'A'.
//!     Types of property 'id' are incompatible.
//!       Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
//! ```
//!
//! tsz previously surfaced union-source elaboration only for *self-heading*
//! members (leaf relations and the `MissingProperty`/`MissingProperties`
//! summaries); a member that failed structurally fell through to the bare
//! top-level `Type 'A | B' is not assignable to type 'T'` line, hiding which
//! member and which position/property was responsible. Routing tuple-element
//! and property-type mismatches through `UnionSourceMismatch` with an explicit
//! member header reproduces tsc's chain.
//!
//! These tests vary the binder names (alias/property spellings) so a fix keyed
//! to a particular spelling would not satisfy them, and they assert
//! structurally (the chain names the failing member, the position/property, and
//! the leaf relation) rather than depending on exact type-printer rendering.
