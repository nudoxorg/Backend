//! Regression coverage: `protected` member assignability is *hierarchical*,
//! not strictly nominal like `private`.
//!
//! Tracks the `binder-11-20` "augmentation drops private/protected mirror
//! visibility" family (tsz-org/tsz#11631).
//!
//! Structural rule under test:
//!
//! > When a target property is `protected`, a source object is assignable as
//! > long as the source property is declared in the target's
//! > protected-declaring class *or in a class derived from it*. The source is
//! > allowed to widen the member from `protected` to `public` in the derived
//! > class. (`private` is unaffected: it still requires the exact same
//! > declaration — declaration identity.)
//!
//! This mirrors tsc's `isPropertyInClassDerivedFrom` / `isValidOverrideOf`.
//! Behavior was verified against `tsc` 6.0.2 for every case below.
//!
//! Per the anti-hardcoding directive (§25) the cases vary the user-chosen
//! member and class names (`p`/`kind`/`items`, `Base`/`Shape`/`Repo`) and
//! include a generic variant, so a fix keyed on a specific spelling would fail
//! at least one case.
