//! Regression coverage for the per-walk memoization of the CALL flow-node
//! narrow/divert classification (#13311).
//!
//! Structural rule: when the backward flow walk crosses a CALL flow node it must
//! decide whether that call can narrow or divert the queried reference (a
//! never-returning call or an `asserts` predicate). That decision is a pure
//! function of the call node within a single walk — it reads the immutable
//! per-check type cache and resolved type-predicate tables and never depends on
//! the reference being narrowed. The linear-passthrough chase re-scans
//! overlapping pass-through runs on every worklist pop, and the defer classifier
//! recurses over pass-through call chains, so without a memo a call-dense single
//! scope re-extracts each call's predicate signature thousands of times per
//! reference read (the `check_flow` worklist owns the loop; its cost is
//! `O(distinct reference paths * scope statements)`). Memoizing the
//! classification by flow-node id collapses the redundant extraction to one per
//! call node per walk with no change in narrowing value.
//!
//! These tests pin the value-preservation half of that rule: narrowing across a
//! call-and-guard-dense single function body is unchanged, identifier names do
//! not matter, and an unguarded read still reports the possibly-`undefined`
//! diagnostic (the memo must not over-splice a relevant call into silence). The
//! per-statement cost reduction itself is a constant-factor change validated by
//! the project benchmark, not by an absolute-time assertion here.
