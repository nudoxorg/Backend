//! A union-source `TS2322` elaboration must drill the first-*declared* failing
//! member, even when that member is an enum sharing another enum's structural
//! shape.
//!
//! `tsc` always elaborates a failing union assignment with the union's first
//! member (in the order the union was written); on a tie between two members
//! of the same `TypeFlags` rank (two enums, no other tiebreaker), the printer's
//! own TS7 stable order already keeps enum members in declaration order. The
//! solver's interned union member list, however, is ordered by allocation
//! identity (needed so `E1 | E2` and `E2 | E1` intern to one canonical
//! `TypeId`) — an enum's `DefId`/`TypeId` is allocated lazily, in whatever
//! order the checker first requests its type, which does not track source
//! position. Elaboration selection that walks the interned list directly can
//! therefore name the wrong enum entirely, not just the wrong order.
//!
//! Structural rule: the union-source elaboration arm
//! (`crates/tsz-solver/src/relations/subtype/explain.rs`) ranks its member list
//! through the shared display comparator (`order_union_members_for_display`)
//! before the first-failing-member scan. Same-rank enum members break the tie on
//! their declaration span, so the scan sees them in declaration order — the same
//! order the union header renders — leaving every other member's slot and the
//! nullish-first hoist untouched.
//!
//! Regression guard for #16513.
