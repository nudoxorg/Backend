//! A `var`/`let`/`const` variable does not declaration-merge with a class —
//! only a `function` declaration merges with a class's static side. So when
//! a `.d.ts` `declare class A {}` and a `.js` `const A = {}` share a name
//! (with `allowJs` + `checkJs`), both files report `TS2451` ("Cannot
//! redeclare block-scoped variable") exactly as an ordinary cross-file
//! block-scoped-variable-vs-class conflict would — `checkJs` does not
//! suppress it, and the conflicting initializer must not be checked for
//! assignability against the class's shape (`TS2739`/`TS2741`) — there is no
//! merge to check it against. Verified against the pinned `typescript@7.0.2`
//! oracle: `declare class A {}` + `const A = {}` reports `TS2451` on *both*
//! sides and nothing else.
//!
//! Mirrors `TypeScript/tests/cases/conformance/salsa/jsContainerMergeTsDeclaration3.ts`
//! (`expected:[TS2339,TS2451]`). tsc additionally resolves `A`'s type for
//! *later* references (e.g. an `A.d` property access after the conflicting
//! declaration) to the class's static side, reporting `TS2339` there — a
//! `mergeSymbol` artifact (`checker.ts`): on a flag conflict the pre-existing
//! target symbol is left untouched and the conflicting source's declarations
//! feed only the diagnostic, so *which* declaration wins is decided by file
//! processing order, not by declaration order within a file.
//!
//! `cross_file_variable_class_merge.rs` implements this for ordinary
//! (non-`checkJs`) property-type resolution — see the `ts2339_*` tests
//! below, which cover the rule in pure TS. The `.js` + `checkJs` variant of
//! the same fixture (`ts2451_in_js_when_dts_class_conflicts_with_const`
//! below) is covered separately: a `checkJs` direct-write target runs
//! assignment-target expando-write machinery
//! (`property_access_helpers/expando.rs`) ahead of the generic property-type
//! path, and that machinery used to grant the write unconditionally whenever
//! the merged symbol carried `CLASS` — fixed in
//! `root_symbol_supports_js_expando_read` / `root_symbol_supports_js_direct_expando_write`
//! (reject outright when a symbol carries both `CLASS` and `VARIABLE`, since
//! that combination only ever arises from this exact redeclaration
//! conflict). Verified by
//! `crates/tsz-cli/tests/js_container_merge_class_variable_conflict_expando_cli_tests.rs`
//! — the real project-mode driver, not the entry-only harness used here, is
//! required: the fix depends on the production `global_symbol_file_index`
//! cross-arena merge that unifies `A`'s `.d.ts`/`.js` declarations under one
//! `SymbolId`, which none of the lightweight multi-file test harnesses in
//! this crate reproduce.
