//! TS2462 ("A rest element must be last in a destructuring pattern") for
//! destructuring *assignment* targets.
//!
//! The parser enforces the rule for binding-pattern forms (`let { ...a, b } = x`);
//! assignment targets parse as plain array/object literals, so the checker must
//! enforce it. Previously only top-level *array* assignment targets were checked;
//! object targets and every nested target were silently accepted. These tests
//! pin parity with `tsc` (verified against `typescript@7.0.2`).
