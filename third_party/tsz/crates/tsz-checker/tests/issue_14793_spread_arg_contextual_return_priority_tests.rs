//! Regression for issue #14793: a same-arity contextual return tuple must not
//! override a fully-inferred spread-argument binding for a rest type parameter.
//!
//! Root cause: after the solver resolved `f<T extends readonly unknown[]>(...args:
//! T): T` to a concrete `T = [number, string]` from the spread argument `f(...t)`,
//! the checker's generic-call finalize (`call/inner.rs`) re-applied the contextual
//! return type as `T`. Its "do the args fit the contextually-instantiated params?"
//! guard accepts position-swapped tuples, because the rest element type of
//! `[string, number]` is `string | number`, which both `number` and `string`
//! satisfy. The replaced result equalled the annotation, so the outer
//! variable-initializer assignability check trivially passed and the real `TS2322`
//! was lost.
//!
//! Fix: a contextual return type may still preserve ordinary literal inference
//! for non-spread arguments, but it must not replace a tuple already pinned by a
//! spread argument feeding the same bare rest type parameter returned by the call
//! (tsc's inference priority: the spread/rest positional candidate outranks a
//! same-arity contextual-return candidate).
//!
//! Each test varies the callee/type-parameter/binding names so the fix is
//! exercised structurally, never through an identifier or file-name predicate.
