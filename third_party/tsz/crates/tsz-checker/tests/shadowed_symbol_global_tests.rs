//! Regression tests for issue #2871 — a locally-bound `Symbol` must not
//! be treated as the built-in global `Symbol`.
//!
//! Two distinct compiler paths special-case the global `Symbol` value:
//!
//! 1. The const-initializer shortcut in
//!    `tsz_checker::types::computation::helpers::is_symbol_call_initializer`
//!    that infers `unique symbol` for `const k = Symbol()`.
//! 2. The computed-property classifier in
//!    `tsz_checker::state::state_checking_members::index_signature_checks
//!    ::is_symbol_named_property` that decides whether `[Symbol.x]` is
//!    symbol-keyed (and thus exempt from string-index TS2411 checks) or a
//!    regular literal-keyed member.
//!
//! Before the fix, both paths matched any callee/object identifier whose
//! spelling happened to be `Symbol`. After the fix, both paths verify that
//! the `Symbol` reference is *not* shadowed by a local declaration.
//!
//! These tests intentionally use multiple shadowing identifier names where
//! the directive in CLAUDE.md §25 calls for it; the helper must drive its
//! decision off binder identity, not the spelling of any particular
//! variable.
