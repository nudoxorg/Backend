//! TS2322 tuple length-mismatch elaboration parity with `tsc`.
//!
//! When a closed tuple source has a different fixed length than a tuple target,
//! `tsc` keeps the `TS2322` headline and attaches a nested reason line:
//!   - source longer than target allows -> `Source has N element(s) but target
//!     allows only M.` (`TS2619`)
//!   - source shorter than target requires -> `Source has N element(s) but
//!     target requires M.` (`TS2618`)
//!
//! The solver already produces the arity `SubtypeFailureReason`; this exercises
//! the checker render boundary that previously dropped the reason at the
//! top-level (`depth == 0`) and rendered non-`tsc` wording when nested.
//!
//! Binder/type-parameter names are varied across cases so the rendering is
//! proven structural, not keyed on a fixture identifier.
