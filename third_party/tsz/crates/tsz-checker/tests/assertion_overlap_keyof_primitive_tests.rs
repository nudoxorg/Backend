//! Tests for TS2352 assertion-overlap with the `keyof T` type operator.
//!
//! Conformance test:
//! `TypeScript/tests/cases/conformance/types/keyof/keyofAndIndexedAccess.ts`
//! line 187: `const x2 = k as string;` where `k: keyof T`.
//!
//! `keyof T` reduces to a subset of `string | number | symbol`, so for
//! assertion overlap purposes it is comparable to any of those primitives
//! (or their literals). tsc's `isTypeComparableTo` walks the `keyof` to its
//! key-space union; without this case, an assertion like
//! `(k as string)` falls through to the property-overlap check (`KeyOf` has
//! no extractable properties) and emits a false-positive TS2352.
