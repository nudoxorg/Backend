//! Regression coverage for #14153: the `in` operator must narrow a *type alias /
//! generic application* union to the member declaring the key.
//!
//! Structural rule: when the `in` receiver is a union reached through a type
//! alias instantiation or generic application (e.g. `Enumerable<T> = ArrayLike<T>
//! | Iterable<T>`), `tsc`'s `narrowTypeByInKeyword` filters the constituents of
//! the *resolved* union — true branch keeps members whose apparent type has the
//! (string-literal) key, false branch keeps the complement. tsz now resolves the
//! alias/application to its structural union before the union-vs-non-union
//! decision in the solver `in`-narrowing path, so `"length" in items` narrows to
//! the `ArrayLike<T>` member and `items.length` is `number`.
//!
//! Before the fix the alias instantiation reached narrowing as an unresolved
//! generic application (not a raw union), `union_list_id` returned `None`, the
//! union-filtering path was skipped, and the receiver fell through to the
//! non-union branch (`union & Record<prop, unknown>`), so the property read back
//! as `unknown` — remeda's `length.ts:35` emitted a false `TS2322` (`unknown`
//! not assignable to `number`).
//!
//! A non-literal computed key (`k in x`, `k: string`) must still NOT narrow
//! (negative control). Verified against `tsc` 5.8.3.
//!
//! The remeda witness uses `ArrayLike<T> | Iterable<T>`; these cases use
//! lib-free generic aliases of the same shape (a generic application union where
//! one member declares the key) so the checker test harness resolves every name
//! while still exercising the unresolved-generic-application resolution path.
