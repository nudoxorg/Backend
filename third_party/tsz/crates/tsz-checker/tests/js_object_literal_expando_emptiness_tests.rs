//! A JS variable initialized with a NON-EMPTY object literal is a closed
//! shape, not an expando host: a later write to an undeclared member is an
//! ordinary property assignment, reported `TS2339` under `noImplicitAny`.
//!
//! Closes #17226. The structural rule (tsc `getExpandoInitializer`):
//!
//! > A `var X = {…}` object-literal initializer hosts expando members only when
//! > the literal is EMPTY (`properties.length === 0`); a prototype assignment
//! > (`X.prototype = {…}`) relaxes this. A non-empty literal keeps its closed
//! > inferred shape, so `X.newMember = …` / `X.newMember` is `TS2339` under
//! > `noImplicitAny`. Function and class expression initializers remain expando
//! > hosts regardless of content.
//!
//! `tsz` accepted ANY object-literal initializer as an expando host at three
//! sites — the checker read/write predicates
//! (`root_symbol_supports_js_expando_read`,
//! `root_symbol_supports_js_direct_expando_write`) and the binder registration
//! (`is_expando_init`) — so the write was silently accepted even under
//! `noImplicitAny`, a false negative. Each site now gates the object-literal
//! branch on `arena.is_empty_object_literal(...)`.
//!
//! The `noImplicitAny`-OFF open-container leniency
//! (`js_open_object_receiver_under_implicit_any`) is unchanged: it lives at the
//! `TS2339` emission site and keeps the same write silent when `noImplicitAny`
//! is off, matching tsc. The matrix below flips only `no_implicit_any` between
//! otherwise-identical runs (the tsconfig-sentinel oracle method).
