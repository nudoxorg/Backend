//! Fourslash-style test harness for LSP features.
//!
//! Provides a declarative test DSL inspired by TypeScript's fourslash test format.
//! Tests use markers (`/*name*/`) in source text to identify cursor positions,
//! then verify LSP features like hover, definition, completions, references, etc.
//!
//! # Architectural boundary
//!
//! This module is a **test harness only**. It owns all knowledge of fourslash
//! marker syntax.
//!
//! The harness is responsible for translating a marker-annotated source string
//! into:
//!
//! 1. A *cleaned* source string with the marker comments stripped out, and
//! 2. A set of marker positions expressed as plain `(file, line, character)`
//!    tuples in the cleaned coordinates.
//!
//! **Production LSP provider modules (`completions`, `hover`, `signature_help`,
//! `navigation`, `rename`, `diagnostics`, `project`, ...) must not import from,
//! depend on, or inspect anything in this module.** They must not branch on
//! marker-like comments, recognize marker names, reorder results to match
//! fourslash expectations, or read fourslash-specific directives.
//!
//! Any request sent from a fourslash test into LSP code is first converted to
//! the ordinary LSP inputs: file URI, document text, and cursor offset/range.
//! The LSP code behaves exactly as it would for a user-typed file opened in an
//! editor.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use tsz_lsp::fourslash::FourslashTest;
//!
//! let mut t = FourslashTest::new("
//!     const /*def*/x = 42;
//!     /*ref*/x + 1;
//! ");
//!
//! // Verify go-to-definition
//! t.go_to_definition("ref")
//!     .expect_at_marker("def");
//!
//! // Verify hover
//! t.hover("def")
//!     .expect_display_string_contains("const x: number");
//! ```
