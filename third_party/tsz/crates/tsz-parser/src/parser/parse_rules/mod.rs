//! Parsing rule modules
//!
//! This module contains extracted parsing logic organized by category.
//! Each module focuses on a specific aspect of parsing (expressions, statements, etc.)
//!
//! ## Design Notes
//!
//! Expression parsing logic is implemented directly in `state.rs` using methods
//! on `ParserState` for optimal performance and simpler control flow. The precedence
//! climbing algorithm for binary expressions and all primary/unary expression parsing
//! are integrated into the main parser state.
//!
//! JSX fragment detection (`<>`) is performed inline during parsing rather than via
//! lookahead for efficiency - no backtracking is needed when we can check for `>`
//! immediately after consuming `<`.
