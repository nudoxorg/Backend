//! Parser - Cache-optimized parser using `NodeArena`
//!
//! This parser uses the Node architecture (16 bytes per node vs 208 bytes)
//! for 13x better cache locality. It produces the same AST semantically
//! but stored in a more efficient format.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - Uses `NodeArena` instead of `NodeArena`
//! - Each node is 16 bytes (vs 208 bytes for fat Node enum)
//! - Node data is stored in separate typed pools
//! - 4 nodes fit per 64-byte cache line (vs 0.31 for fat nodes)
