//! Integration tests for solver strictness improvements.
//!
//! This module tests the comprehensive solver improvements made in SOLV-15, SOLV-18, and SOLV-19:
//! - Generic type constraints (SOLV-15): Using constraints instead of falling back to Any
//! - Tuple type subtyping (SOLV-18): Covariant tuple subtyping with proper length handling
//! - Function type variance (SOLV-19): Proper contravariance for parameter types
//!
//! These integration tests verify TS2322 and TS7006 error detection improves with strictness.
