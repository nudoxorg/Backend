//! Regression tests for issue #16089 — the O(1) nominal fast path that
//! `class_instance_extends_target_def` provides for a plain `interface W
//! extends Window {}` source never fired for an INTERSECTION source like
//! `Window & { extra: number }`: `check_object_subtype`'s short-circuit only
//! runs on a single evaluated `ObjectShape`, and an intersection source is
//! merged into one property set before that point, losing the per-member def
//! identity the fast path needs. So a source that merely mixes in an extra
//! property with a DOM-lib interface still paid the full structural walk
//! (and could time out) even though the underlying interface member alone
//! nominally proves the relation.
//!
//! `intersection_member_nominally_extends_target` is the fix: a per-member
//! check run in `visit_intersection` before the merged-property structural
//! path. It is sound as an unconditional early accept — subtyping is
//! transitive, so `Member <: Target` implies `(Member & Other) <: Target`
//! for any `Other` — which is exactly why checking one member in isolation,
//! ignoring the rest of the intersection, is safe here (unlike the general
//! "any member is a subtype" shortcut `visit_intersection` deliberately
//! disables for object-like targets to avoid accepting genuinely conflicting
//! intersections through the slower structural comparison).
//!
//! These are white-box tests of `intersection_member_nominally_extends_target`
//! itself, constructed with a fake `TypeResolver`, for the same reason
//! `objects_interface_nominal_fastpath_tests.rs` is: the fast path and the
//! structural walk it short-circuits must reach the same verdict by
//! construction, so a checker-level diagnostics diff cannot distinguish
//! "took the fast path" from "the slow path happened to agree." The real
//! DOM-lib performance win is verified separately by timing the real `tsz`
//! binary against the issue's own `Window & {..}` witnesses.
