//! Consolidated depth/fuel limit policy and thread-local budget state for the
//! solver's evaluation / instantiation / relation stack (issue #13091).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The recursive solver operations are bounded by a family of *named,
//! per-operation-class* limits, exactly as `tsc`'s `checker.ts` runs distinct
//! `instantiationDepth` / `instantiationCount` / relation-depth /
//! `relationCount` / tail-recursion budgets. The limits are deliberately NOT
//! unified into one depth+fuel pair: each class has different firing
//! semantics (hard `TS2589` error vs. silent opaque bail vs. assumed-related
//! `Ternary.Maybe`), and this policy area is regression-prone in both
//! directions (a depth-bail policy change once caused a 7.1x `ts-toolbelt`
//! slowdown, #6973 → recovered in #7210).
//!
//! What WAS consolidated here is the *mechanism*:
//! - every limit constant is defined (or re-exported) in this one module, so
//!   the whole policy surface is auditable at a glance;
//! - the scattered per-counter `thread_local!` cells are merged into one
//!   [`LimitBudgets`] struct behind a single `thread_local!`, so hot paths
//!   that touch several counters per frame resolve TLS once (macOS
//!   `__tls_get_addr` is ~10-15ns per access; see the same optimization note
//!   in `intern/core/interner/cache.rs`);
//! - the limit-hit result-cache policy from issue #13241 (`maybeKeys`
//!   promotion kill switch, fuel-band honesty helper) lives here so any
//!   future per-class `Maybe` promotion is wired in one place.
//!
//! Thresholds are intentionally byte-for-byte identical to their previous
//! scattered definitions: behavior preservation is the acceptance gate.

//! # Known double-fire / divergence findings (documented, NOT changed here)
//!
//! - `tsz_common::limits::MAX_INSTANTIATION_DEPTH` (100, checker-side TS2589,
//!   tsc parity) vs the solver instantiator's [`MAX_TYPE_SUBSTITUTION_DEPTH`]
//!   (50) carried the *same name* in two crates with different values. The
//!   solver constant is renamed here to make the divergence visible; the
//!   public `instantiation::instantiate::MAX_INSTANTIATION_DEPTH` alias keeps
//!   its value (50). Aligning to tsc's 100 would be a behavior change
//!   requiring its own witness.
//! - [`DEFAULT_MAX_EVAL_OPS_PER_QUERY`] and [`MAX_EVALUATION_FUEL`] both
//!   mirror tsc's `instantiationCount` and both count evaluator work (every
//!   `evaluate` op per query vs. guard iterations per file, sampled at
//!   [`EVAL_FUEL_CHECK_INTERVAL`]). They fire for different runaway shapes
//!   (cross-instance bounce vs. cumulative file budget) and cannot be merged
//!   without changing which witness bails first.
//! - The same recursive descent is depth-counted by up to three stack guards
//!   (per-instance guard depth 100, cross-evaluator depth 200, shared solver
//!   frames 2000) at different scopes. Their counter *updates* were partially
//!   deduplicated (single-TLS frame entry), but all three limits are kept:
//!   each catches a recursion shape the others structurally cannot.
//! - The evaluator's per-`TypeId` structural depth (100) and per-`DefId`
//!   expansion depth ([`MAX_DEF_DEPTH`] = 100) count the same conditional
//!   descent; which fires first decides silent-opaque vs. TS2589. The
//!   [`REAL_INSTANTIATION_BAILOUT_THRESHOLD`] = 40 escalation floor is the
//!   deliberate tie-breaker (calibration notes at the constant).
