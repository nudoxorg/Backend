//! Shared option-bag scaffolding for cache-keyed solver stages.
//!
//! Lives under `caches` (the crate-root file budget is full) and is re-exported
//! as `crate::options`, the path the request modules import.
//!
//! Several solver stages (`evaluation`, `narrowing`, `instantiation`) carry a
//! small bag of boolean compiler-option flags that participate in their cache
//! key. Idiomatic Rust derives the `const new` / `with_*` / getter builder once
//! rather than hand-writing the same triple per stage. This module owns:
//!
//! - [`solver_options!`], a `macro_rules!` that emits that builder triple for a
//!   declared flag list. It is used by [`IndexAccessOptions`] here and by the
//!   `EvaluationOptions` / `NarrowingOptions` / `InstantiationOptions` stages.
//! - [`IndexAccessOptions`], the shared two-flag newtype embedded by both
//!   `EvaluationOptions` and `NarrowingOptions` (which carry the identical
//!   `{no_unchecked_indexed_access, exact_optional_property_types}` pair and
//!   thread it into their cache keys; see issue #10970 for why omitting a flag
//!   from a key is a correctness footgun).
//!
//! Behavior is unchanged: the generated methods keep the exact names,
//! signatures, and field order of the previous hand-written builders, and the
//! derived `Hash`/`Eq` on [`IndexAccessOptions`] hashes its two fields in the
//! same order as the old inlined `bool` pair, so cache-key hashing is
//! byte-identical.

/// Emit the `const new` / `with_*` / getter triple for an option-bag struct.
///
/// The struct itself is declared by the caller (so crate architecture guards
/// that grep for the literal `pub struct <Name>` declaration keep matching, and
/// so each stage controls its own derives and doc comment). This macro only
/// generates the `impl` block over a flat list of `bool` fields.
///
/// Each entry is `<getter> / <setter>`, where `<getter>` names a `bool` field on
/// `$ty` (and becomes the getter method) and `<setter>` is the `with_*` builder
/// method name. The setter name is supplied explicitly rather than derived,
/// because concatenating identifiers in a `macro_rules!` arm requires unstable
/// metavariable expressions. The macro generates:
///
/// - `pub const fn new() -> Self` with every flag `false`;
/// - `pub const fn <setter>(mut self, enabled: bool) -> Self` per flag;
/// - `pub const fn <getter>(self) -> bool` per flag.
