//! Type inference engine using Union-Find.
//!
//! This module implements type inference for generic functions using
//! the `ena` crate's Union-Find data structure.
//!
//! Key features:
//! - Inference variables for generic type parameters
//! - Constraint collection during type checking
//! - Bounds checking (L <: α <: U)
//! - Best common type calculation
//! - Efficient unification with path compression
