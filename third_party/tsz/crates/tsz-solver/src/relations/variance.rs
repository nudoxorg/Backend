//! Variance calculation for type parameters.
//!
//! This module implements variance analysis for generic type parameters,
//! enabling O(1) generic assignability checks by determining whether type
//! parameters are covariant, contravariant, invariant, or independent.
//!
//! ## Variance (Task #41)
//!
//! Variance determines how subtyping of generic types relates to subtyping
//! of their type arguments:
//!
//! - **Covariant**: `Box<Dog>` <: `Box<Animal>` if `Dog` <: `Animal`
//! - **Contravariant**: `Writer<Animal>` <: `Writer<Dog>` if `Dog` <: `Animal`
//! - **Invariant**: `MutableBox<Dog>` <: `MutableBox<Animal>` only if `Dog === Animal`
//! - **Independent**: Type parameter not used - can be skipped in checks
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! The `VarianceVisitor` traverses types while tracking polarity:
//! - **Positive polarity** (covariant positions): function returns, array elements
//! - **Negative polarity** (contravariant positions): function parameters
//! - **Both polarity** (invariant): mutable properties with different read/write types
//!
//! Cycle detection uses `(TypeId, Polarity)` pairs to allow correct variance
//! calculation for recursive types like `type List<T> = { head: T; tail: List<T> }`.
//!
//! Also supports lazy type resolution, recursive variance composition,
//! and Ref(SymbolRef) type handling.

/// [`VarianceComputer`] and re-walks the entire (possibly deep, lazy-ref-heavy)
/// type graph from scratch — the dominant cost when checking large
/// generic-alias-heavy projects.
///
/// This helper computes the mask **using the supplied resolver** (never the
/// query database's own resolver, which may not see local alias bodies) and
/// wires two persistent tiers into the [`VarianceComputer`]:
///
/// 1. the universe-shared interner store (`TypeDatabase::shared_def_variance`),
///    reachable from every relation/evaluation path including those without a
///    `QueryDatabase`, shared across files and child checkers; and
/// 2. the per-checker session cache exposed by [`QueryDatabase`], kept for the
///    query database's own resolver paths.
///
/// ## Soundness gates (canonical masks and resolution fingerprints)
///
/// A [`VarianceComputer`] tracks `active_defs` to truncate cyclic
/// self-references (returning the "independent" placeholder mask). The mask a
/// nested `DefId` produces mid-walk is a pure function of its resolved body
/// **only when its subtree never back-edged into a def that was already on the
/// recursion stack below its own frame**: such a back-edge would be truncated
/// at the ancestor instead of at the def itself, yielding a context-dependent
/// (provisional) mask. The visitor-level nesting counters (`mapped_depth`,
/// `method_bivariant_depth`, `inside_unreliable`, `bound_type_params`) never
/// cross a `compute_def_variances` boundary — each nested def starts fresh
/// visitors at base context — so in-flight def dependency is the exact
/// condition for context sensitivity.
///
/// The computer therefore tracks, per def frame, the minimum stack depth of
/// any in-flight dependency observed in its subtree (including dependencies
/// inherited by consuming a provisional per-walk cache entry). A frame whose
/// subtree minimum is not below its own depth produced the same mask a fresh
/// top-level query would produce — canonical — and is promoted regardless of
/// nesting depth. Provisional (cycle-tentative) masks are never promoted;
/// they stay in the per-walk map exactly as before.
///
/// Resolver dependence is handled by a resolution-failure fingerprint: each
/// frame records the defs whose params/body/lazy resolution failed in its
/// subtree. A canonical mask is stored in the shared tier together with that
/// fingerprint, and a consumer replays it only after validating that every
/// fingerprint def still fails to resolve under its own resolver — under that
/// condition the stored mask is exactly what the consumer's fresh walk would
/// compute. Walks that hit non-fingerprintable gaps (failed `SymbolRef`
/// resolution, session-cache masks of unknown cleanliness) are opaque and
/// never reach the shared tier.
///
/// Only fully-resolved (`Some`) results are memoized. A `None` (unresolved or
/// non-generic) result is not cached, so a later reference made after the
/// definition's body becomes resolvable still recomputes.
