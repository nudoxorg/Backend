//! Best-matching-member selection for object-to-union failure elaboration.
//!
//! When an object value fails to assign to a union target, `tsc`'s
//! `getBestMatchingType` picks the single union member to elaborate the failure
//! against. It tries, in order:
//!
//! 1. `findMatchingDiscriminantType` — a written unit discriminant on the
//!    source (`kind: "a"`) selects the member whose discriminant it matches,
//!    regardless of raw key overlap;
//! 2. `findMostOverlappyType` — otherwise the member sharing the most
//!    property-name keys with the source, ties broken by the *last* such member
//!    (`tsc` compares overlap with `>=`);
//! 3. no member at all when nothing overlaps (`findMostOverlappyType` needs a
//!    unit-typed key intersection), leaving the bare union line.
//!
//! `SubtypeChecker::explain_failure`'s structural-union arm (`explain.rs`)
//! previously implemented only step 2, so a discriminated union
//! (`{ kind: "a"; x } | { kind: "b"; y }` given `{ kind: "a" }`) tied on the
//! shared `kind` key and elaborated the *last* member — naming the wrong
//! missing property — and a source with no overlap picked an arbitrary member
//! `tsc` never elaborates. These helpers restore the full ordering.
