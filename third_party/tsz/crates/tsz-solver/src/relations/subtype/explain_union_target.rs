//! Union-**target** failure explanation: best-member selection and the
//! elaboration reason carried past the bare union head line.
//!
//! Extracted from `explain.rs`'s structural walk. When a relation fails
//! against a union target, `tsc` continues the diagnostic chain past
//! `Type 'S' is not assignable to type 'A | B'.`: an application-shaped
//! comparison folds to a direct missing-property line, a sole-real-member
//! nullable union promotes the member's own reason, a union source recurses
//! per member, and a structural union selects the best-matching member
//! (`getBestMatchingType`, see `explain_union_discriminant.rs`) whose failure
//! is carried in [`SubtypeFailureReason::UnionTargetMismatch`].
