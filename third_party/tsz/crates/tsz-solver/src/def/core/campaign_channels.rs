//! Canonical registry of the `#14344`/`#14345` identity / materialize-once
//! campaign env channels.
//!
//! The campaign accumulated a family of default-OFF env flags (issue #15317).
//! Several of them make the shared-store `DefId` allocation / canonical election
//! observable, which is the surface the historical run-to-run election flap
//! manifests under. Rather than have
//! [`deterministic_store_election_enabled`](super::semantic_construction::deterministic_store_election_enabled)
//! re-derive its own hand-picked subset (the pre-#15317 code keyed off only 4 of
//! the publication channels, leaving a determinism hole for compositions such as
//! `XARENA_BASE + HERITAGE`), the whole substrate set is enumerated here
//! once and consumed from a single place.
//!
//! Each entry is the *env variable name* of a campaign substrate channel. The
//! flags are activated in real gauges only through these process-global env vars
//! (their per-flag gates are `OnceLock`s over the same names), so reading the env
//! here is exactly the signal that decides whether a composed gauge is running
//! any env-activated identity-affecting channel. Declaration-scoped type
//! identity is a typed per-project option, not an env channel. Enabling
//! deterministic election is a no-op
//! superset — it only pins `DefId` allocation to the sound home-decl order — so
//! listing a channel that turns out not to perturb election is safe; omitting one
//! that does is the bug this module exists to prevent.
//!
//! Measurement-only channels (`TSZ_DEF_PUBLICATION_CENSUS`,
//! `TSZ_TYPEPARAM_DIVERGENCE_PROBE`, `TSZ_XARENA_BASE_DECL_DUMP`) and the
//! counter-only depth knob (`TSZ_REREDUCE_DEPTH_CAP`) are deliberately excluded:
//! they emit diagnostics or tune a budget without changing which type is elected.
//!
//! The graduation ledger (`docs/plan/campaign-flag-ledger.md`) is the
//! human-readable companion; this array is the machine-checked one. Keep them in
//! sync — the ledger's channel table and this list must name the same flags.
