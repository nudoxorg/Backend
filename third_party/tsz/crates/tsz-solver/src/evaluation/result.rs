//! Typed result boundary for type evaluation.
//!
//! The evaluator still emits a single `TypeId` today, but this wrapper names
//! the result stage so future cache/provenance metadata can be attached
//! without threading loose tuples through the evaluation engine.
//!
//! # Termination channel (#14346 scaffold)
//!
//! Beyond the evaluated `TypeId`, the result now carries an explicit
//! [`Termination`] verdict mirroring the instantiation result's typed
//! termination precedent (`crate::instantiation::result`). The verdict names
//! *whether* a bound (depth, fuel, solver-stack frame budget, cross-eval
//! cycle, query-op budget) cut the walk short and, if so, which one — instead
//! of letting an
//! outer collapse silently treat a budget-truncated partial as a finished
//! type.
//!
//! The channel is parity-safe: every consumer collapses through
//! [`EvaluationResult::into_type_id`], which returns the relation-preserving
//! `partial` (= the same opaque `TypeId` the bail produced before the channel),
//! so the emitted type and diagnostics are byte-identical. As of #14346
//! stage 3 the [`crate::evaluation::evaluate::TypeEvaluator::evaluate_request_result`]
//! producer reports [`Termination::Incomplete`] for every one of the six bail
//! classes: stage 2 wired [`TerminationKind::IterationExceeded`] (the
//! per-evaluator iteration limit), and stage 3 wired the five guards that
//! already carried a `record_eval_termination_guard` observability counter —
//! [`TerminationKind::DepthExceeded`], [`TerminationKind::FuelExhausted`],
//! [`TerminationKind::SolverStackFrames`], [`TerminationKind::CrossEvalCycle`],
//! and [`TerminationKind::QueryOpBudget`] — through the shared
//! `note_request_termination` helper (first-wins: the verdict names the guard
//! that first truncated the walk). Each still surfaces the same `partial` and
//! preserves the existing cache taint, so the collapse is byte-identical; the
//! verdict is additive metadata a later stage (cache eligibility as a property
//! of the result) can act on.
