//! Type evaluation for meta-types (conditional, mapped, index access) and
//! generic type applications.
//!
//! Meta-types are "type-level functions" that compute output types from input types.
//! This module provides evaluation logic for:
//! - Conditional types: T extends U ? X : Y
//! - Distributive conditional types: (A | B) extends U ? X : Y
//! - Index access types: T[K]
//! - Generic type applications: `Base<Args>` (see the `application` submodule)
//!
//! Key design:
//! - Lazy evaluation: only evaluate when needed for subtype checking
//! - Handles deferred evaluation when type parameters are unknown
//! - Supports distributivity for naked type parameters in unions
