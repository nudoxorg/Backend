//! Re-entrant guard for the mapped-keys extraction walk.
//!
//! `extract_mapped_keys_impl` recurses through `resolve_lazy` def bodies, and
//! mutually-referential bodies (`A`'s shared-store body referencing `Lazy(B)`
//! while `B`'s references `Lazy(A)`) would otherwise recurse without progress
//! until stack overflow. Resolution forms are not guaranteed acyclic —
//! per-checker refinement and shared-store publication can produce forms that
//! point at each other — so a same-`TypeId` re-entry returns `None` (defer),
//! matching the existing "cannot extract keys" semantics.
