//! Substitution-independent persistent evaluation cache (`closed_eval_cache`).
//!
//! Recursive TypeBox-style shapes (`Static<T,P> = (T & {params:P})['static']`,
//! `PropertiesReduce<T,P> = { [K in keyof T]: Static<T[K], P> }`) re-evaluate the
//! same closed subtrees thousands of times across the many fresh `TypeEvaluator`
//! instances that instantiation and the checker's first/second passes spin up.
//! This module memoizes the evaluation of *substitution-independent* nodes in a
//! project-wide cache so that work is O(1) on repeat shapes.
//!
//! Caching here can only change speed, never results, because of three gates:
//!  - **Input gate**: the cached node contains no `TypeParameter`/`Infer`/
//!    `ThisType`/`BoundParameter`, so its evaluation does not depend on the
//!    active substitution environment — only on the project's single fixed
//!    resolver (via any `Lazy`/`TypeQuery` refs). The mapping is stable per
//!    `TypeId`.
//!  - **Write gate** (kind-split): the meta-operation kinds
//!    (`IndexAccess`/`KeyOf`/`Application`) commit only from the checker's
//!    authoritative, context-free type-resolution pass (the
//!    `with_closed_eval_writes` plus `with_query_db` boundary, a *complete*
//!    resolver); a resolver-backed
//!    mid-relation/inference/narrowing evaluator runs against a *partial*
//!    resolver (lib/utility bodies in the `resolver_generation()==0` registration
//!    window not yet materialized) and can compute a definite-but-under-resolved
//!    meta-operation head that diverges from the resolved answer
//!    (`partialOfLargeAPIIsAbleToBeWorkedWith`); a closed `Conditional` is exempt
//!    and may commit from any top-level evaluation, because it has no operand
//!    whose deferred/under-resolved expansion the meta-operation kinds key on
//!    (its branch selection either resolves definitely or the run is already
//!    excluded by the `unresolved_def_seen`/`tainted`/limit gates); caching the
//!    closed conditionals the resolver-backed contexts compute and re-compute is
//!    the deep-recursion win, and reads stay open to every evaluator since a
//!    stored value is always a fully-resolved answer.
//!  - **Limit gate**: a run that returned a typed incomplete
//!    [`crate::evaluation::result::EvaluationResult`] verdict, or hit any
//!    legacy recursion/complexity limit (`deep_recursion_seen`, the `TS2589`
//!    depth machinery, or the `TS2590` union-too-complex flag), caches nothing
//!    — a cached read must never short-circuit an expansion the type system must
//!    continue in order to re-derive those diagnostics. A run that evaluated an
//!    application whose base `DefId` had no resolvable body
//!    (`unresolved_def_seen`) also caches nothing: its results are
//!    registration-window artifacts that would permanently shadow the answer
//!    derived after the real body registers.
