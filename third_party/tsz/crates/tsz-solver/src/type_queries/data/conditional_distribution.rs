/// Resolve a conditional type whose check type is `any` to the union of both
/// branches, matching tsc's `getConditionalType` (a conditional with an `any`
/// check type evaluates to `trueType | falseType` — the wildcard takes both
/// arms). Non-conditional types, and conditionals with a non-`any` check type,
/// are returned unchanged.
///
/// General conditional evaluation (`evaluate_type`) already performs this
/// union, so this helper exists for callers that hold a still-unevaluated
/// conditional and hand it straight to a relation without an evaluation step —
/// notably `getErasedSignature`-style overload/implementation return comparison,
/// where the overload's type parameters have been substituted with `any` and the
/// resulting `any extends U ? A : B` reaches the relation raw. Distributing here
/// keeps the false branch (which the relation would otherwise drop by resolving
/// the `any` check to a single true-branch pick).
