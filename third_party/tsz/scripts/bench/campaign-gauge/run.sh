# Committed gauge for the #14344/#14345 identity + materialize-once campaign.
#
# The campaign's asset is almost entirely flag-ON behavior that nothing
# exercises, and every direction-driving number was hand-run with no committed
# script (issue #15317). This script is the single source of truth for the
# composed substrate stack: it exports the exact flag set once, then
#   - flag-tests (GATING): runs the flag-ON tests designed to pass under the
#     stack — the hkt body-publication tests plus the channel-registry /
#     election-ordering unit tests;
#   - determinism (GATING): compiles a committed cross-file HKT-augmentation
#     fixture N times and asserts byte-identical diagnostics (the flap guard);
#   - census (NON-GATING): runs the full solver suite under the stack and banks
#     the pass/fail envelope — the 2^13 composition space is NOT green by design,
#     so this reports drift rather than gating.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/bench/campaign-gauge/run.sh [all|flag-tests|determinism|census]
#
# Env overrides:
#   TSZ_GAUGE_REPEATS   determinism repeat count (default 3)
#   TSZ_BIN             path to a prebuilt `tsz` binary for the determinism check
#                       (default: build `-p tsz-cli --release` into target/release)
#   TSZ_FPTS_DIR        optional fp-ts fixture dir; when present, the fp-ts row is
#                       run REPEATS times and its diagnostic count asserted stable
#
# Exit non-zero on any suite failure, a determinism mismatch, or a fixture the
# gauge could build but that produced non-reproducible output.
